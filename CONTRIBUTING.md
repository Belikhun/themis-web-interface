# Contributing Guidelines

## What do I need to know to help?
If you are looking to help to with a code contribution our project uses `php` and `javascript` as the main language. You might also need some `html` and `css` skill too. Also, we don't use any front-end framework. If you don't feel ready to make a code contribution yet, no problem! You can also check out the [issues tracker](https://github.com/Belikhun/themis-web-interface/issues)

For creating a pull request, make sure the target branch is `main`, otherwise, we will simply reject your pull request.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make sure your code lints.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Belikhun/themis-web-interface/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Belikhun/themis-web-interface/issues/new?labels=bug%2C+help+wanted&template=bug_report.md); it's that easy!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Use tab size of 4 rather than space
* Brace placement should follow **K&R** style, for example
	```js
	while (x == y) {
		something();
		somethingelse();
	}
	```
